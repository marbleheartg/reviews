# Security Audit Log

Date: 2025-10-02

This repository was scanned for exposed secrets and hardened GitHub Actions workflows. Summary of actions and recommendations:

- No suspected plaintext secrets were found in the current tree or last 50 commits using patterns for AWS, GitHub PAT, Google API, Stripe, Slack, private keys, or generic tokens/passwords.
- Recommended immutable pinning for actions:
  - `actions/checkout@08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955` (v4.3.0)
  - `actions/dependency-review-action@56339e523c0409420f6c2c9a2f4292bbb3c07dd3` (v4.8.0)
- Recommended fork-PR guardrails for workflows that use secrets or write permissions to avoid leaking secrets to forks:
  - Add to jobs that run on `pull_request`: `if: ${{ !github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork }}`
  - Additionally gate secret-using steps: `if: ${{ env.CURSOR_API_KEY != '' }}` or equivalent
- Permissions are present in all workflows; keep least-privilege. For security reporting, `security-events: write` may be added when needed.

Notes:
- Workflow file changes could not be pushed from this automation due to missing `workflows` permission. The above edits are recommended and safe; please apply them via PR.

Compare changes and quick-create a PR from `audit/hardening` if desired.
